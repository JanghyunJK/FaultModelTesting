The accumulation increases the flow resistance of the air duct and changes the airflow and pressure drop across the duct in accordance with the controls of the fan rotational speed. This fault is categorized as a fault that occur in the ventilation system during the operation stage. This fault measure is based on an empirical model and simulates duct fouling by modifying either Fan:ConstantVolume, Fan:VariableVolume, Fan:OnOff, or Fan:VariableVolume objects in EnergyPlus assigned to the air system. F is the fault intensity defined as the reduction in evaporator coil airflow at full load condition as a ratio of the design airflow rate with the application range of 0 to 0.5 (50% reduction).",

          "description": "Compared to scheduled lighting operation, using an occupancy sensor for the lighting control is more suitable when the space is intermittently occupied. In other words, when the space is left with the lights on for large amount of portion throughout the day, it is better to use the occupancy sensor to save the lighting energy consumption. However, setting a time delay in the occupancy sensor is a trade-off between occupant’s visual discomfort and energy savings. If the time delay is too short, chances increase for energy savings. But on the other side, lights being on and off too often increases visual discomfort for occupants in the space. 15 minutes of time delay is common in the real application, however, the setting can be improperly implemented in the field. This fault measure is based on a physical model where certain parameter(s) is changed in EnergyPlus to mimic the faulted operation; thus simulates the effect of an improper time delay setting in occupancy sensors by modifying the Schedule:Compact object in EnergyPlus assigned to lighting schedules. This fault is categorized as a fault that occur in the lighting system (controller) during the operation stage. The fault intensity (F) is defined as the delayed time setting (in hours).",

          "description": "Condenser fouling occurs when litter, dirt, or dust accumulates on or between the fins of a condenser of an air conditioner located in the outdoor environment. The blockage reduces the airflow across the condenser and increases the condensing temperature in the refrigerant circuit. The elevated temperature increases the pressure difference across the compressor and reduces the equipment efficiency. This fault is categorized as a fault that occur in the vapor compression system during the operation stage. This fault measure is based on an empirical model and simulates condenser fouling by modifying the Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed or Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumiditycontrolmodes object in EnergyPlus assigned to the heating and cooling system. The fault intensity (F) for this fault is defined as the ratio of reduction in condenser coil airflow at full load with the application range of 0 to 0.5 (50% reduction).",

          "description": "Evaporator fouling occurs when the filter upstream of a cooling/evaporator coil is fouled. This fault decreases the evaporator saturation temperature, which decreases overall cooling capacity, sensible heat ratio (SHR), and coefficient of performance. The lower SHR leads to an increased latent load to meet a particular sensible load. This fault is categorized as a fault that occur in the vapor compression system during the operation stage. This fault measure is based on an empirical model and simulates evaporator fouling by modifying the Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed or Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumiditycontrolmodes object in EnergyPlus assigned to the heating and cooling system. F is the fault intensity defined as the reduction in evaporator coil airflow at full load condition as a ratio of the design airflow rate with the application range of 0 to 0.5 (50% reduction).",

          "description": "A liquid-line restriction fault occurs when particles accumulate within the refrigerant filter located between the condenser and the expansion valve in the refrigerant circuit of a vapor compression cycle. The accumulation increases the flow resistance of the refrigerant circuit and the pressure difference across the compressor. It also reduces the evaporating temperature and leads to lower cooling capacity, efficiency, and SHR. The lower SHR leads to increased latent load to meet a particular sensible load. This fault is categorized as a fault that occur in the vapor compression system during the operation stage. This fault measure is based on an empirical model and simulates a liquid-line restriction by modifying the Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed or Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumiditycontrolmodes objects in EnergyPlus assigned to the heating and cooling system. The fault intensity (F) is defined as the ratio of increase in the pressure difference between the condenser outlet and evaporator inlet due to the restriction with the application range of 0 to 0.3 (30% increase).",

          "description": "Forty four user inputs (DX coil where the fault occurs / Percentage reduction of refrigerant charge level / rated cooling capacity / rated sensible heat ratio / rated volumetric flow rate / maximum fault intensity / undercharge and overcharge empirical model coefficients / minimum-maximum evaporator air inlet wet-bulb temperature / minimum-maximum condenser air inlet dry-bulb temperature / minimum/maximum rated COP / percentage change of UA with increase of fault level / time required for fault to reach full level / fault starting month / fault starting date / fault starting time / fault ending month / fault ending date / fault ending time) can be defined or remained with default values. Based on user inputs, the cooling capacity (Q ̇_cool) and EIR in the DX cooling coil model is recalculated to reflect the faulted operation. The time required for the fault to reach the full level is only required when the user wants to model fault evolution. If the fault evolution is not necessary for the user, it can be defined as zero and F will be imposed as a step function with the user defined value. However, by defining the time required for the fault to reach the full level, fault starting month/date/time and fault ending month/date/time, the adjustment factor AF is calculated at each time step starting from the starting month/date/time to gradually impose F based on the user specified time frame. AF is calculated as follows, AF_current = AF_previous + dt/tau where AF_current is the adjustment factor calculated based on the previously calculated adjustment factor (AF_previous), simulation timestep (dt) and the time required for the fault to reach the full level (tau).",

          "description": "When an air conditioner, heat pump, or refrigeration unit is not properly evacuated prior to being charged with refrigerant, the unit runs with a mixture of air and refrigerant. Because it is noncondensable, the air inside the refrigerant circuit typically is trapped in the high-pressure vapor downstream of the compressor, and the pressure difference across the compressor and the compressor power consumption increase. This fault is categorized as a fault that occur in the vapor compression system during the operation stage. This fault measure is based on an empirical model and simulates the presence of the noncondensable by modifying the Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed or Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumiditycontrolmodes objects in EnergyPlus assigned to the heating and cooling system. The fault intensity (F) is defined as the ratio of the mass of noncondensable in the refrigerant circuit to the mass of noncondensable that the refrigerant circuit can hold at standard atmospheric pressure with the application range of 0 to 0.6 (60% noncondensable).",
