In other words, when the space is left with the lights on for large amount of portion throughout the day, it is better to use the occupancy sensor to save the lighting energy consumption. However, setting a time delay in the occupancy sensor is a trade-off between occupantΓÇÖs visual discomfort and energy savings. If the time delay is too short, chances increase for energy savings.

      "description": "The return duct of an air system typically operates at negative pressure, thus the leakage in the return duct (outside of conditioned space) results in increased heating and cooling load due to unconditioned air being drawn into the return duct and mixing with return air from conditioned spaces. This fault is categorized as a fault that occur in the ventilation system (duct) during the operation stage. This fault measure is based on a physical model where certain parameter(s) is changed in EnergyPlus to mimic the faulted operation; thus simulates the return air leakage by modifying the Controller:OutdoorAir object in EnergyPlus. The fault intensity (F) is defined as the unconditioned air introduced to return air stream at full load condition as a ratio of the total return airflow rate.",

Conditioned air leaking to an unconditioned space in buildings increases the equipment heating or cooling demand and can increase fan power for variable air volume systems. This fault is categorized as a fault that occur in the ventilation system (duct) during the operation stage. This fault measure is based on a physical model where certain parameter(s) is changed in EnergyPlus to mimic the faulted operation; thus simulates supply air leakage by modifying the ZoneHVAC:AirDistributionUnit object in EnergyPlus.
