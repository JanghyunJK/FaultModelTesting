In other words, when the space is left with the lights on for large amount of portion throughout the day, it is better to use the occupancy sensor to save the lighting energy consumption. However, setting a time delay in the occupancy sensor is a trade-off between occupantΓÇÖs visual discomfort and energy savings. If the time delay is too short, chances increase for energy savings. But on the other side, lights being on and off too often increases visual discomfort for occupants in the space. 15 minutes of time delay is common in the real application, however, the setting can be improperly implemented in the field.

The fault intensity (F) is defined as the reduction in motor efficiency as a fraction of the non-faulted motor efficiency with the application range of 0 to 0.3 (30% degradation).",

Based on user inputs, the cooling capacity (Q ╠ç_cool) and EIR in the DX cooling coil model is recalculated to reflect the faulted operation. The time required for the fault to reach the full level is only required when the user wants to model fault evolution. If the fault evolution is not necessary for the user, it can be defined as zero and F will be imposed as a step function with the user defined value. However, by defining the time required for the fault to reach the full level, fault starting month/date/time and fault ending month/date/time, the adjustment factor AF is calculated at each time step starting from the starting month/date/time to gradually impose F based on the user specified time frame. AF is calculated as follows, AF_current = AF_previous + dt/tau where AF_current is the adjustment factor calculated based on the previously calculated adjustment factor (AF_previous), simulation timestep (dt) and the time required for the fault to reach the full level (tau).",
